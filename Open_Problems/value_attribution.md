# Value Attribution in a Network of Contributions

## Introduction to the problem

As we continue working towards an open and decentralized future, new incentives, attribution structures, and algorithms will play an increasingly important role. This is not just in the context of _project contributions_ such as labor, capital, technology or insights (in the context of SourceCred and network organizations like Protocol Labs) but also in the context of _digital creation and attribution_ (in the context of the Metaverse and leveraging the unique content addressable network that  the Protocol Labs technology stack enables). 

The ability to create fair, transparent, and strong incentives for different groups to work towards a common goal will be a powerful tool. Subjective questions such as how impact is measured, evaluated, benchmarked -- and the mechanism and governance process through which this is administered -- can be expected to have an impact on how  the effectiveness of these programs.

Similarly, as teams work towards an open and permissionless Metaverse, there are also interesting value-attribution questions raised as people compose digital assets to construct new ones. 

## State of the Art

### Current approaches within the CryptoEconLab and broader research ecosystem

This Open Problem refers to  a general class of  **impact evaluation** applications, of which e.g. [SourceCred](https://sourcecred.io/) and are Protocol Lab's approach to [Networked OKRs & Milestone Bounties](https://youtu.be/pJqdkuOMe98) and [Impact Evaluators](https://youtu.be/dpLtrugjfMc) specific implementations. This class of applications is particularly relevant to the problem of [retroactive public goods funding](https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/retroactive-public-goods-funding-33c9b7d00f0c), and these tools make use of the observation that "it's easier to agree on what _was_ useful than on what _will be_ useful. ([1](https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/retroactive-public-goods-funding-33c9b7d00f0c))"

We see parallels between this problem and the question of *marketing attribution*: the process of determining the value of marketing communications in customer acquisition and behavoiur and assigning it to interactions with different nodes in the customer journey, estimating the incremental value of each contact and the spillove effects along the path to purchase (e.g. [1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0268401220314523?via%3Dihub),[2](https://pure.rug.nl/ws/files/81649379/The_path_to_purchase_and_attribution_modeling_Introduction_to_special_section.pdf), [3](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2343077)). Research into crowdsourcing has provided insights into the appropriate forms of organization for different tasks conducted in a peer production or open innovation environment (e.g. [4](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0165551514550140)). 

Approaches to credit attribution from the field of [bibliometrics](https://garfield.library.upenn.edu/papers/pricenetworks1965.pdf), where academic citations are conceptualized as a network, may also prove useful. The [*colored directed acyclic graphs*](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/Qmed7oNVNfMQftA8zvWxNS7h2JLwkwcGCuBEsAqovEqjPy) proposed by Stephenson and Zargham builds on bibliometric insights to suggest a structure and mechanism for describing and incentivizing information flow across networks and may be extended to represent other directed flows. 

### Known shortcomings of existing solutions

Impact evaluation mechanisms in dynamic, active systems require robust mechanisms for prospectively incentivizing needed work within a network. Additionally, there remain opportunities to extend the impact evaluation model to encompass new and different types of value networks.

## Solving this Open Problem

We seek solutions to the general questions "how is value created and disseminated within a network?" and "how can we incentivize collaborative value creation in a distributed system?"

Ideally, these solutions should be demonstrated in a context where public data is available, and which have appreciable relevance to scientific, open source, and Web3 value creation networks.

### Estimated impact

We expect that contributions to this Open Problem will enable more powerful incentivization and more targeted reward of project contributors and digital value creators in a variety of areas, from scientific research to open-source software to digital art.

Progress in this area will also help us to model value creation and flows within Web3 networks, including the IPFS network of CIDS and the Filecoin network of service providers.

### Notes on existing conversations

Recently we've been modeling this problem in a NFT system, observing  changes in the value of (potentially) correlated NFTs where the value of one NFT shifts.
