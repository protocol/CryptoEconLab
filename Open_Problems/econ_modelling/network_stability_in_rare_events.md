# Scaling structure and network stability

Self-organized criticality provides a framework to reason about relaxation events with burst-like scale invariant power laws[1]. Itâ€™s the common thread across complex systems that links the dynamics of the natural world, from rainfall (think relaxations in the sky!) and earthquakes, to social network tweet storms[2], and rare events in volatile financial markets[3]. 

The Filecoin decentralized network generates millions of unique events per day. We'd like to understand the emergent scaling structure of event cascades, and how this structure  can inform the economic impact of rare events on future network stability. 

These questions might be explored in the context of modeling [Filecoin circulating supply](https://filecoin.io/blog/filecoin-circulating-supply/), understanding the dynamic adjustment of base fees, and examining relationships between storage deal state transitions and other protocol activities. For example, Filecoin uses EIP1559-style[4] gas fees, but how effective are they in practice at regulating volatility[5] in the network, and can a more effective structure be designed?
