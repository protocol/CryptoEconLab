# CryptoEconLab

**Welcome to the CryptoEconLab public repository. Here you will be able to learn about and contribute to our Open Problems, RFPs, and Research Projects, as well as keep tabs on what we're planning for the future.** You can also follow our work on our [Protocol Labs Research webpage](https://research.protocol.ai/groups/cryptoeconlab/) and the [PL Research blog](https://research.protocol.ai/blog/) by [subscribing](https://protocol.us4.list-manage.com/subscribe?MERGE0=&u=09d704b0125b11d44d67d4617&id=7aa0f1150b&subscribe=) to the PL Research newsletter.

## `CryptoEconLab`

Cryptoeconomics is an emerging field of economic coordination games in cryptographically secured peer-to-peer networks. As an interdisciplinary study, cryptoeconomics involves a constellation of knowledge including computer science, network science, statistics, economics, and system engineering. In an increasingly networked and open world, cryptoeconomics will play a bigger role in coordinating human and machine activities and building a better future.

### Mission & Vision

CryptoEconLab at PL aspires to become a hub for research on economic incentives, coordination games, and novel marketplaces. We aim to develop capacity to design, validate, deploy, and govern large-scale economic systems. CryptoEconLab strives to empower projects in the ecosystem through novel incentives and advance humanity’s understanding of multiagent systems and algorithmic steering of economic networks.

The lab’s genesis comes from a growing need to enable the design and deployment of large-scale economic systems, from token networks to the Metaverse. CryptoEconLab is designed to take ownership of the economic aspects of a technosocial system including design, specification, validation, deployment, and governance.

Please [join the discussion](https://github.com/protocol/CryptoEconLab/discussions) to learn how you can work with us!

## Research

CryptoEconLab’s current foci are:

- Formation, diffusion, and learning in networks
- Stochastic optimal control for evolutionary systems
- Evolutionary game theory, population games, state based potential games
- Optimal pricing and resource allocation in distributed networks
- Value attribution and graph-based algorithms
- Market design, algorithmic game theory & differential privacy
- Prediction markets, automated market makers, reputation systems
- Institutional economics and governance


### Open Problems

We welcome discussion of our [current Open Problems](https://github.com/protocol/CryptoEconLab/tree/main/open_problems) on our [github discussion page](https://github.com/protocol/CryptoEconLab/discussions/categories/open-problems-ideas-proposals). Please join us in exploring the future of public good cryptography by contributing to the solution of current problems and posing new ones!

### Projects 

### RFPs
  
 As we develop and post RFPs, they will be posted in [this github repo](https://github.com/protocol/research-RFPs).
  
### Collaborations
  
We are very interested in forming collaborations with researchers and engineers working in our fields of interest, and we offer several grants and research fellowships to support these working relationships. Please check out the [PL Research website](https://research.protocol.ai/outreach/) for further details and application instructions.
