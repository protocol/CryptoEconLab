# CryptoEconLab

**Welcome to the CryptoEconLab public repository. Here you will be able to learn about and contribute to our Open Problems, RFPs, and Research Projects, as well as keep tabs on what we're planning for the future.** You can learn more about our lab in our [website](https://cryptoeconlab.io/) and the [Protocol Labs Research webpage](https://research.protocol.ai/groups/cryptoeconlab/). You can also follow us on [Twitter](https://mobile.twitter.com/cryptoeconlab) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cryptoeconlab/) to keep taps on relevant discussions and information.

## Mission & Vision 💭

Cryptoeconomics is an emerging field of incentive and mechanism design in cryptographically secured peer-to-peer networks. This multidisciplinary endeavor is at the core of every Web3 project, pulling in knowledge from computer science, network science, statistics, economics, and systems engineering. 

CryptoEconLab is Protocol Lab's hub for research on economic incentives, coordination game theory, and novel marketplaces. We aim to develop capacity to design, validate, deploy, and govern large-scale economic systems. CryptoEconLab strives to empower projects in the ecosystem through novel incentives and advance humanity’s understanding of multiagent systems and algorithmic steering of economic networks.

We are applying our learnings to grow and maintain the Filecoin ecosystem, where we are active drivers and participants. Filecoin is a layer1 blockchain that orchestrates a decentralized data storage network designed to store humanity’s most important information - and Filecoin’s unique cryptoeconomic system is central to its design.

## Research 📚

CryptoEconLab’s current focus areas are:

- Incentive & token design
- Optimal pricing and resource allocation in distributed networks
- Real-world experience & business impact
- Network analytics & data-driven monitoring
- Formation, diffusion, and learning in networks
- Modeling & simulation
- Value attribution and graph-based algorithms
- Evolutionary game theory, population games, state-based potential games
- Prediction markets, automated market makers, reputation systems
- Governance process & principles

### Open Problems

We welcome discussion of our [current Open Problems](https://github.com/protocol/CryptoEconLab/tree/main/open_problems) on our [GitHub discussion page](https://github.com/protocol/CryptoEconLab/discussions/categories/ideas-open-problems-and-proposals). Please join us in exploring the future of cryptoeconomics by contributing to the solution of current problems and posing new ones! 

The open problems' folder include research questions that can be used to develop an M.Sc. thesis or a PhD industry-experience project for students in computer science, statistics, data science, complexity, economics or related areas. These questions can also serve as the basis for independent postdoctoral research.

These project ideas can be discussed on the [CryptoEconLab Discussion Board](https://github.com/protocol/CryptoEconLab/discussions); inquiries about opportunities for [grant-supported research](https://grants.protocol.ai/) can be directed to [research-grants@protocol.ai](mailto:research@protocol.ai).

### Research Grants

Protocol Labs has a grant program targeted at supporting research within the scope and mission of the company. It includes topic-specific proposals (the Requests for Proposals or RFPs) and open research awards (which are intended to support researchers pursuing topics of interest to Protocol Labs).

The full details and application process can be found in the dedicated [GitHub repo](https://github.com/protocol/research-RFPs). We encourage the community to read the currently [open RPFs](https://github.com/protocol/research-grants#requests-for-proposals-rfps) and to [apply with topics](https://github.com/protocol/research-grants#open-research-grants) related to our lab's research scope.

 ### Our work

WIP
 
  
### Collaborations
  
We are very interested in forming collaborations with researchers and engineers working in our fields of interest, and we offer several grants and research fellowships to support these working relationships. Please check out the [PL Research website](https://research.protocol.ai/outreach/) for further details and application instructions.

## Community outreach 🧑‍🚀

Please join us for discussion an anything in the CryptoEconLab extended universe on our [discussion forum](https://github.com/protocol/CryptoEconLab/discussions/)
